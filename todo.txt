Move the URLs to other urls.py in inventory folder




Add 'are you sure' pop-up to after user tries to delete form.

-maybe (hard?) have update form pop-up and update w/o refreshing

------------------for sure change variable names in functions, urls, etc.

Ok let's just keep the modal being cloned just because
We have to figure out how to keep the button from disappearing.
Got to apply the changes to the Sales Value as well....


THEN, i guess using fetch?  have the values actually update in Model.

Fix the buttons from disappearing after the submit.

Work on the functionality of the other button to add stock, should be way easier.

Change variable names of some of the stuff??  Whereever I can just to change it up a bit

--Be able to type into the form immediately, and press enter from my keyboard (shouldn't be hard)



Change CSS for table and also background theme/color

Add javascript to confirm if user wants to delete an inventory
