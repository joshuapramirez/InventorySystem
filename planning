so going to experiment with the console.log, have to be able to seperate the buttons from the row, shouldn't7
be hard.  once I can seperate it, I can add the functionality of opening up a form, and then editing the
properties from there.

Add Stock

Add Sale


Tomorrow gotta get form to open up with choice to add sales, and add stock,  should work responsively
if it took me forever to do something simply like seperate the click detected, this prob gonna be hard as shit
but feeling pretty confident that I'll figure it out somehow.

3:57pm, going to start next step of allowing button to open form
